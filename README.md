# tictactoe blahblah

This is a exploration of creating a tic tac toe game using python

To get started make sure you have the following installed.  

1. Python3 https://www.python.org/
2. Visual Studio Code  https://code.visualstudio.com/
3. Git https://git-scm.com/downloads  (if you're unfamiliar with git/github.

If you new to programming, some materials to helping help you get started can be found below

1. How to run python in visual studio code https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o4gDQvVkLU 
2. Learn GIT in 15 mintues https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE&t=69s)
3. Introduction to Programming with Python (cs50p) https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/
4. 100 days of code (python) https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code (paid course on Udemy)


Currently the plan is to create a GUI base tic tac toe game that can be played in either single player or multiplayer mode.


***Schedule***

Week 1:

Install environment + Finish the function to check if there's a winner (check_winner)


Week 2:

Add test cases / quick way to test if game logic is correct.

The idea is if we pass it an end game scenario (i.e. player 1 wins) or a tie scenario  the game logic should be able to detect it.

This is important if we make changes down the line.

Week 3:

Add simple graphical interface, so it's no longer a console app

Week 4:

Add a simple AI that can act as an opponent.
